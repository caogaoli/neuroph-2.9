Neuroph - Java Neural Network Platform Neuroph
======

In order to make Neuroph project easier to use, navigate and maintain this repo has been splitted in two repos which contain Neuroph Framework and Neuroph Studio GUI. These two repos will be active and should be used. This old repo here will remain active for some time, but should not be used for new development and will not include latest additions.
